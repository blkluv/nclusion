## Current Build Plan

This DEVLOG follows the phased delivery plan defined in `prd.md`:

1. **P0: Discovery and Scope Lock**
2. **P1: Foundations**
3. **P2: Core Betting Loop**
4. **P3: Demo Hardening**
5. **P4: MVP Operational Hardening**
6. **P5: Production Readiness**

The product goal is a low-bandwidth, Android-first sports betting platform for the Haitian market, using HTGN and Solana devnet for the trust-critical path of escrow and settlement.

---

## Phase Summary

### P0: Discovery and Scope Lock
- Lock the narrowest credible MVP.
- Finalize supported markets, statuses, provider choices, and demo assumptions.
- Confirm the architecture baseline before implementation begins.

### P1: Foundations
- Stand up the mobile, backend, Solana, and platform scaffolding.
- Establish shared schemas, persistence, localization, and deployment basics.
- Create the baseline developer workflow for implementation and validation.

### P2: Core Betting Loop
- Implement the end-to-end user flow: browse matches, place a bet, relay on-chain, settle, and view receipts.
- Build the balance model, history, receipt endpoints, relay, and Solana instruction path.
- Make the core loop demonstrable from mobile UX through on-chain confirmation.

### P3: Demo Hardening
- Improve offline behavior, lifecycle clarity, localization quality, and support tooling.
- Validate degraded-network behavior and duplicate-prevention scenarios.
- Make the assignment demo reliable, polished, and easy to explain.

### P4: MVP Operational Hardening
- Add failover, cross-provider settlement checks, telemetry, alerts, and risk controls.
- Strengthen support tooling and operational visibility.
- Bridge the gap between a compelling demo and a pilot-capable MVP.

### P5: Production Readiness
- Define compliance, governance, custody, support, and infrastructure hardening work.
- Clarify operational policy and incident readiness.
- Capture the delta between MVP credibility and production-grade launch conditions.

## Milestones To Track

### MVP / Demo Completion

Track these against the acceptance criteria in `prd.md`:

- A user can sign in and see a localized home screen.
- A user can browse real football matches and basic odds.
- A user can place a single HTGN bet.
- The bet is submitted through the relay and confirmed on Solana devnet.
- The UI shows clear bet lifecycle statuses.
- The user can see balance changes and history.
- A match result can be processed and the bet can be settled.
- The user can inspect a receipt with advanced proof fields.
- Cached history and match browsing still work when network conditions degrade.
- A basic operator view can verify the bet and settlement lifecycle.

### Production Readiness Completion

- Multi-RPC failover is operational.
- Operator tooling covers disputes and reconciliation.
- Custody, recovery, and secrets boundaries are hardened.
- Compliance and support workflows are defined.
- Settlement disputes can be paused and reviewed safely.
- Telemetry and alerts catch stuck bets and failed settlements.

## Architectural References

Use these references inside ticket entries when relevant:

- `requirements.md` for scope, constraints, and MVP boundaries
- `interviews.md` for trade-off rationale and architectural decisions
- `systemsdesign.md` for service boundaries, state flows, and data model guidance
- `prd.md` for phase plan, ticket definitions, and acceptance criteria
- `index.md` for cross-document navigation

Common recurring decisions:

- Managed per-user wallets with future export potential
- Backend transaction relay with idempotency and fee sponsorship
- On-chain escrow and settlement, off-chain odds and support state
- Aggressive caching and explicit offline states
- Optional advanced receipts for trust and dispute handling
