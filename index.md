# Project Document Index

## Project Summary

This project defines a mobile-first sports betting platform for the Haitian market that uses HTGN stablecoins and Solana devnet for escrow and settlement while keeping blockchain complexity out of the main user experience.

The document set consistently emphasizes:

- low-bandwidth Android-first design,
- invisible blockchain UX,
- trust through clear status and receipts,
- off-chain orchestration with on-chain settlement,
- and a narrow MVP focused on high-interest football matches.

### Wallet and Account Model

- Requirements baseline: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- Decision rationale: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- Architecture and service boundary: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- Delivery tickets and rollout: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- managed per-user wallets with future export potential.

### Bet Placement and Transaction Flow

- Product requirement: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- Reliability rationale: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- End-to-end placement flow: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- Implementation plan: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- backend relay, idempotency keys, deterministic bet IDs, and explicit lifecycle states.

### On-Chain vs Off-Chain Boundary

- Constraint framing: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- Trade-off rationale: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- Architecture definition: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- Product positioning: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- keep escrow, canonical bet state, and settlement on-chain;
- keep odds, caching, indexing, UX state, and support views off-chain.

### Offline and Poor Connectivity

- User requirement: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- UX rationale: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- Offline flows and failure handling: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- demo hardening tasks: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- cache aggressively, allow draft intents, revalidate before submission, and never show false finality.

### Balances, History, and Receipts

- Requirement definition: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- User-trust rationale: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- Balance/history/indexer model: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- delivery scope and tickets: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- show `Available`, `In active bets`, and `Pending settlement`;
- keep advanced proof optional through receipts.

### Settlement and Result Integrity

- Requirement definition: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- rationale for provider cross-checking: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- settlement service design: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- backlog for settlement orchestration: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- trusted result ingestion, secondary provider cross-check, and manual hold for disputed outcomes.

### Localization and Market Fit

- Market requirement: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- UX guidance: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- mobile design implications: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- delivery framing: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- Haitian Creole by default, French secondary, and no partial localization.

### Operations, Support, and Trust

- Operational requirements: [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- business rationale: [`interviews.md`](./interviews.md)
- ops dashboard and observability: [`systemsdesign.md`](./systemsdesign.md)
- support tooling backlog: [`prd.md`](./prd.md)

Recommended position:

- receipts, support tooling, dispute workflows, and operator visibility are core product infrastructure.

## Major Cross-Document Decisions

- Use Solana only for the trust-critical path, not as the primary UX surface.
- Optimize for Haitian mainstream mobile users, not crypto-native users.
- Favor a narrow World Cup-focused MVP over broad sportsbook coverage.
- Treat unreliable connectivity as a default operating condition.
- Prioritize reliability, clarity, and settlement correctness before growth loops.

## Open Questions Still Repeated Across Documents

- ~~What exact HTGN devnet model will be used for the demo?~~ **Resolved in [`techstack.md`](./techstack.md):** SPL Token on devnet, platform-controlled mint, 2 decimals.
- ~~Which odds and result providers should be selected for MVP quality and cost?~~ **Narrowed in [`techstack.md`](./techstack.md):** The Odds API or API-Football. Final selection during P0 after testing World Cup fixture coverage.
- What level of login and identity verification is expected for the assignment?
- How much operator tooling is required to look credible without overbuilding?
- ~~What is the exact boundary between a convincing demo and production readiness?~~ **Addressed in [`production.md`](./production.md):** demo deploys as a combined Railway server at ~$5/mo with a clear scaling path for production.
